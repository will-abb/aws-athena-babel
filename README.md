# ob-athena

**Run AWS Athena queries directly from Org Babel in Emacs.**

`ob-athena` is an Emacs package that allows you to write and execute AWS Athena SQL queries from Org-mode source blocks using Org Babel. It leverages the AWS CLI to submit queries, monitors their status in real time, and displays results in both CSV and JSON formats.

[See a video demonstration](https://youtu.be/2VoVpH3ceG0)

[Watch **Source Header Explanation** video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVAfLEuNcc4) to learn how athena Org Babel header works and how to configure them for queries.

## Features

- Submit Athena queries via AWS CLI directly from Org Babel blocks
- Asynchronous query monitoring in a dedicated `*Athena Monitor*` buffer
- Live status updates with execution metrics and cost estimation
- Console-style result rendering in Org-mode tables
- JSON conversion from CSV output using the Miller (`mlr`) tool
- CSV and JSON views with dedicated keybindings
- Supports result reuse with Athena Workgroups
- Displays full Athena Console URLs for easy web access
- Provides local raw result file (`/tmp/<query-id>.csv`) for inspection or scripting
- Accepts full Org Babel header arguments:
  - `:aws-profile`, `:database`, `:s3-output-location`, `:workgroup`, etc.
  - Also supports execution configuration like `:poll-interval`, `:fullscreen`, etc.
- Automatically replaces `${var}` placeholders in queries using `:var` bindings
- Keybindings for quick actions:
  - `C-c C-k`: Cancel running query
  - `C-c C-c`: Show raw CSV output
  - `C-c C-j`: Show JSON output (requires Miller `mlr`)
  - `C-c C-a`: Open Athena Console link in browser
  - `C-c C-l`: Open local CSV result in Emacs

## Requirements

- Emacs ≥ 26.1
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Properly configured AWS credentials (via profile or environment)
- Athena output location configured in S3
- If you plan to use the json formater, install [Miller Tool](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller)

## Installation

### Doom Emacs

Add the following to your Doom Emacs `packages.el`:

```emacs-lisp
(package! ob-athena
  :recipe (:host github :repo "will-abb/aws-athena-babel"))
```

Then in your `config.el`:

```emacs-lisp
(after! org
  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("athena" . sql)))
```

Then same as below but `use-package!`

### Regular Emacs

If you're using `use-package` in your Emacs config, you can load `ob-athena` like this:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package ob-athena
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/ob-athena"
  :commands (org-babel-execute:athena)
  :config
  (setq ob-athena-s3-output-location "s3://your-bucket/path/"
        ob-athena-workgroup "primary"
        ob-athena-profile "default"
        ob-athena-database "default"
        ob-athena-poll-interval 3
        ob-athena-fullscreen-monitor-buffer t
        ob-athena-result-reuse-enabled t
        ob-athena-result-reuse-max-age 10080
        ob-athena-console-region "us-east-1"
        ob-athena-csv-output-dir "/my-result-directory"))
```

*With support for source block headers arguments in v2.0.0 and up you can set variables there instead, allowing per query settings.*

## Usage

1. In an Org-mode buffer, insert a source block with header arguments on the same line:
   ```org
   #+begin_src athena :aws-profile "default" :database "yourdb" :s3-output-location "s3://your-bucket/path/" :workgroup "primary" :poll-interval 3 :fullscreen t :result-reuse-enabled t :result-reuse-max-age 10080 :console-region "us-east-1" :var user="john.doe@example.com"
   SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE user = '${user}' LIMIT 10;
   #+end_src
   ```
2. Run the block using `C-c C-c` inside the source block
3. Query progress and metrics appear in the `*Athena Monitor*` buffer
4. Press:
   * `C-c C-c` to view raw CSV.
   * `C-c C-j` to view JSON output (parsed using `mlr`)
   * `C-c C-l` to open the local CSV result file
   * `C-c C-a` to open the Athena Console in your browser
5. Results are saved by default to `/tmp/<query-id>.csv`
*Currently this package does not support running concurrent queires. Run only one query at a time*
## Output Rendering

- **Org Table**: Console-style format based on Athena's CSV output
- **CSV**: Raw download from S3, shown in a dedicated buffer
- **JSON**: Automatically converted using the `mlr` tool (`mlr --icsv --ojson`)
- **Local CSV**: Saved to system temp dir and openable with `C-c C-l`
- **Console Link**: Openable in browser via `C-c C-a`

*The queries and the outputs have mostly been tested with CloudTrail buckets.*

##  Hints

`ob-athena` supports regular Org Babel header arguments like `:results output`, `:exports both`, `:wrap`, `:prepend`, and `:post`.
If you have a custom variable that is a supposed to be a string, surround it in quotes. This prevents org babel from interpreting it as a number. For example: account="058264325787", without the quotes the leading number in the account number would be removed.

In `queries.org`, I’ve compiled a list of useful queries. These are queries that have worked for me, but they haven’t been extensively tested. I'm always looking to add queries that others find helpful. Most of them are likely related to querying the CloudTrail bucket.

For using mutiple variables that defined by org babel use ":var" followed by the variables. For texample

:var account="208648672950" region="us-west-2" other_var_integer=12345
